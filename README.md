PyExasol is the officially supported Python connector for [Exasol](https://www.exasol.com). It helps to handle massive volumes of data commonly associated with this DBMS.

You may expect significant performance improvement over ODBC in a single process scenario involving pandas or polars.

PyExasol provides an [API](https://exasol.github.io/pyexasol/master/api.html) to read & write multiple data streams in parallel using separate processes, which is necessary to fully utilize hardware and achieve linear scalability. With PyExasol you are no longer limited to a single CPU core.
