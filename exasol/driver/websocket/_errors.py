    Exception raised for important warnings like data truncations while inserting, etc.

class Error(Exception):
    """
    Exception that is the base class of all other error exceptions.

    """
    Exception raised for errors that are related to the database interface rather than
    the database itself.

    """


class OperationalError(DatabaseError):
    """

    """


class IntegrityError(DatabaseError):
    """
    Exception raised when the relational integrity of the database is affected,

    syntax error in the SQL statement, wrong number of parameters specified, etc.
    """


class NotSupportedError(DatabaseError):
    """
    Exception raised in case a method or database API was used which is not supported
    by the database, e.g. requesting a .rollback() on a connection that does not
    support transaction or has transactions turned off.
