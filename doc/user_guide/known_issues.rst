``ssl.SSLError: Underlying socket connection gone (_ssl.c:...)``
------------------------------------------------------------------

This error can occur in rare cases, for additional details see `GH-Issue #108 <https://github.com/exasol/pyexasol/issues/108>`_
and ``pyexasol.connection.ExaConnection:__del__``.
The root cause of this issue usually stems from a connection not being properly closed before program exit (interpreter shutdown).

Example Output:
