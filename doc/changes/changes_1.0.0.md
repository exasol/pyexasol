# 1.0.0 - 2025-07-14

## Summary

## Documentation update

This release comes with updated documentation. In particular, the user guide now guides
the user through installation, configuration, and PyExasol's most important features.

### Websocket in connection

From PyExasol version `1.0.0`, the default behavior has been changed to use strict
certificate verification in `ExaConnection` and `pyexasol.connect`. This means that
the default `websocket_sslopt=None` will be mapped to
`{"cert_reqs": ssl.CERT_REQUIRED}`. The prior default behavior was to map such cases
to `{"cert_reqs": ssl.CERT_NONE}`.

* For many users relying on the previous default behavior for encrypted connections,
simply upgrading to version `1.0.0` is likely to lead to breaking changes with error
messages like: `[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed`.

Prior to the upgrade:
1. Please determine which encryption and security measures are appropriate for your
organization by reading through [user_guide/encryption](https://exasol.github.io/pyexasol/master/user_guide/encryption.html).
2. If needed, update your usage of `pyexasol.connect(...)` & `ExaConnection` to
reflect your organization's needs.

### IMPORT & EXPORT

In Exasol DB versions prior to version 2025.1, the behavior of the database
was to have TLS certificate validation deactivated for `IMPORT` and `EXPORT`
queries, leaving connections potentially vulnerable to security risks like
man-in-the-middle attacks. Users needed to explicitly enable TLS certificate
validation using custom parameters or SQL syntax.

Starting with Exasol version 8.32.0, TLS Certificate Validation is available for `IMPORT` and `EXPORT` queries, ensuring secure data transfers
by validating certificates for external file connections like HTTPS and
FTPS. For more details, see
[CHANGELOG: TLS Certificate Verification for Loader File Connections](https://exasol.my.site.com/s/article/Changelog-content-16273). This
certificate validation behavior is the default behavior starting with Exasol version
2025.1. For more details, see [CHANGELOG: Default TLS Certificate Validation Enabled for Import/Export Queries](https://exasol.my.site.com/s/article/Changelog-content-25090).

Pyexasol uses a self-signed certificate for the encrypted `http_transport`
methods, which means that such queries would fail the enabled TLS certificate
validation (available from Exasol DB version 8.32.0), as the provided
certificate is not a *globally trusted certificate*.  Thus, from version
`1.0.0`, PyExasol adapts the default behavior of its `ExaSQLThread` to include
clauses like `PUBLIC KEY 'sha256//<sha256_base64_encoded_public_key>'` in
these statements. Here's an example of an `EXPORT` query sent to an Exasol DB:

```sql
    EXPORT my_table INTO CSV
    AT '127.18.0.2:8364'
    PUBLIC KEY 'sha256//YHistZoLhU9+FKoSEHHbNGtC/Ee4KT75DDBO+s5OG8o=' FILE '000.gz'
    WITH COLUMN HEADERS
```

Additionally, the `http_transport` methods have been modified to more explicitly evaluate the
`import_params` and `export_params` dictionaries, which were passed into the `IMPORT` and `EXPORT` queries.
The previous behavior did not validate all the contents of a dictionary, but it would access needed ones with `dict.get(key)`.
To make it more explicit what our `http_transport` methods support, we now pass the
dictionary to the `http_transport.ImportQuery` and `http_transport.ExportQuery` classes, so keys that we do not yet support would raise an exception.
